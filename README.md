# GarryBotController
A flask web application to control GarryBot, a battlebot created for CS2210.
The web application is designed to communicate with the raspberrypi 4 to control GPIO pins. 
By turning different pins on and off on the raspberry pi, we can make the robot turn in different directions, move forwards, and arm the main weapon.
